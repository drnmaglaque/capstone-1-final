              <p>We know of the joy that comes to our hearts when we reminisce those good, golden times we've had. Our goal is simple and straightforward everytime we're out: Seize the moment. Hence, the inspiration for the name of our small, but professional team of photographers, videographers, and make-up artists. We are very much mindful of the important stories and great events in our client's lives, and we are certain we can turn photographs into paragraphs, and it will be as if looking through your album will feel more like reading a novel. A novel about you.</p>

                <p>Markus was 16 when he started to have an interest in photography. He loves taking pictures of people, and has a very keen eye for details. With this passion and ability, he also began to love editing photos, specializing in photo enhancement and manipulation. With 7 years of experience, he had his fair share of joys and challenges during events, and he has learned how to adapt best in any situation where he may find himself in, just to take those perfect moments. He is one of the team's most enthusiastic members.</p>
